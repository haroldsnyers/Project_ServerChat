# Project_ServerChat

To start chatting, you can eather open 3 command prompts and follow the next steps. 	 				
In the first one, start the server by enterring "server_final.py". 
In the 2 others, you can start the chat by enterring "client_final.py".

You will also be able to start this program in the terminal of your code editor.
To do so, run the server once and run the chat atleast twice to be able to communicate between the users.

When you will have run the chat, you will be asked to enter the IP Adress of the host which runs the server.
You will be also asked the port of that host (important to use the same one).

After enterring your username, the different commands will be displayed.

Before starting to chat you will have to connect to the server by enterring "/connect".
After that enter "/clients" to display the list clients who are connected. 
Enter "/join (+pseudo)" to connect with one client.
Enter "/send (+message)" to send a message to the client you connected with (you have to join before 
being able to send something).
Enter "/quit" to stop the conversation with the client you were connected with.
And finally enter "/exit" to exit the application/server.
